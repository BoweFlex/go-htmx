# go-htmx

This is meant to be a basic example of a dynamic site using the go+htmx stack. If/when I decide on a specific application for this, I will most likely rename the repo.

This is a pretty blatant clone of awesome_club's [go-htmx project](https://github.com/awesome-club/go-htmx). I wanted to follow what he had done [here]() to make sure I understood the basics, then expand it into my own thing.
Loose plan from here is:
- Change to use tailwind for styling
- Build homepage (BoweGo?)
- Change existing stocks stuff to subpath under homepage
- Build out other subpaths, i.e:
  - [books](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api)
  - [exchange rates](https://github.com/BoweFlex/CurrencyConverter)
